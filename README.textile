h1. Will Paginate Liquidized

h2. About

This fork updates the will_paginate-liquidized plugin to work with WillPaginate 3.0.

h2. Caveats

Changes to the original:

* the liquid method has been renamed to will_paginate from will_paginate_liquid.

Ongoing issues with this project include:

* currently has only been tested within my own project running Rails 3.0.3. needs further testing on 2.2.x and 2.3.x.

h2. Setup / Using

h3. Requirements

What do you need?

* "Rails":http://rubyonrails.org >= 2.2, 3.0
* "Liquid":http://github.com/tobi/liquid/tree/master >= 2.0.0 (as a gem or plugin)
* "Will-Paginate":http://wiki.github.com/mislav/will_paginate >= 3.0 (as a gem or plugin)

h3. Installing

Rails 2:
<pre>script/plugin install https://github.com/tronfu/will_paginate-liquidized.git</pre>

Rails 3:
<pre>rails plugin install https://github.com/tronfu/will_paginate-liquidized.git</pre>

h2. Using

In your controller you might have something like this;

<pre>
  class MoviesController < ApplicationController
    # GET /movies
    # GET /movies.xml
    def index
      @movies = Movie.all.paginate(:page => params[:page], :per_page => 10)
      respond_to do |format|
        format.html # index.html.erb
        format.xml  { render :xml => @movies }
      end
    end
  end
</pre>

In your view put something like this in movies/index.html.erb;

<pre>
  <%= Liquid::Template.parse("{{ movies | will_paginate }}").render({'movies' => @movies}, :registers => {:controller => @controller}) %>  
</pre>

*NOTE:* you must remember to pass the current controller in rendering (:registers). If anyone can think of a way around this let me know.

You won't get any pagination links until you exceed 10 (per_page setting defined in controller action). You can also pass the following other optional arguments to the will_paginate_liquid method.

<pre>
  {{ movies | will_paginate : 'anchor', 'prev_label', 'next_label' }}
  
  anchor: apply a #anchor to all generated urls in the pagination
  prev_label: label for the previous page button
  next_label: label for the next page button
</pre>


h2. What does the code do?

Registers a new filter tag for Liquid to access will_paginate using a custom LinkRenderer so it can reference the @controller from the current liquid context[:registers]. Uses ActionView::Helpers::UrlHelper, ActionView::Helpers::TagHelper for constructing the pagination links.
